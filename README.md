# Open Sourcing the Origin Stories: The ml5.js Model and Data Provenance Project

Because machine learning algorithms automatically learn to complete tasks, it might be easy to forget that they are human-designed software imbued with the values of their creators. I researched the origins of ml5.jsâ€™ pre-trained models and the data they were trained on to help the ml5.js community learn more about the models for their projects. This article describes the research process, my findings, and how you can contribute to this ongoing work.
